1. Give the outputs and explain how to get the results.

#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

class TPoint
{
public:
     TPoint(int x,int y) {X=x;Y=y;}
     TPoint(TPoint& p);		//copy constructor
     ~TPoint() {cout<<"Destructor called."<<endl;}
     int Xcoord() {return X;}
     int Ycoord() {return Y;}
private:
     int X,Y;
};
TPoint::TPoint(TPoint& p)
{
     X=p.X;
     Y=p.Y;
     cout<<"Copy_initialization Constructor called.\n";
}
TPoint Value(TPoint Q)    // Pass by data value
{     cout<<"OK! "<<endl;
     int x, y;
     x=Q.Xcoord()+10;
     y=Q.Ycoord()+20;
     TPoint R(x,y);
     return R;        // Return R's data value
}
void main()
{     
	TPoint M(20,35),P(0,0);

    TPoint N(M);    //M is a created object, N is a creating object
    P = Value(N);

    cout<<"P="<<P.Xcoord()<<", "<<P.Ycoord()<<endl;
}



2£®Create a class, LINT, to save a big integer which is no more than 100 digits.
   Define a member function to achieve the sum of two big numbers such as following:

class LINT
{
private:
    ¡­¡­
public:
    LINT Add(const LINT&  L);  // Achieve the sum of two big numbers
    void Print(); // Print a big integer
    ¡­¡­
};

   NOTES: You can define appropriate member functions and variables.



3. Usually we access database in ODBC or JDBC. In the process the PrepareStatement(It's a class.) will be used to void SQL injection.
   So it's used to construct SQL statement like these: 
   ÀýÈç£º
   void main()
   {
        ParseSQL sql = "select ?, ? from student where gender = ? and height >= ? order by ?";

        sql.SetAttribute("1", "SID");
	sql.SetAttribute("2", "Name");
        sql.SetAttribute("3", "female");
	sql.SetAttribute("4", "165");
 	sql.SetAttribute("5", "gender");

	sql.ExecuteSQL();
    }

    Here is the outputs:

    select SID, Name from student where gender = female and height >= 165 order by gender

OR if sql has error, you should give the error information.

    Note:
    1. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5   It's not nessary that the numbers is always continuous.
    2. What do you do if the question, ? , does not correspond to the number?
